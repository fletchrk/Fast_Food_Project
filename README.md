Selected topic: Fast Food Restaurants across the United States
Reason why they selected their topic: The team selected this topic based on common interests among the team members. Several other topics were considered such as personality tests, Michelin restaurants and topics related to the pandemic. However, we settled on Fast Foods for logistical reasons, such as access to a complete data set. 
Description of their source of data: The data set was obtained from kaggle.com and was uploaded by Datafiniti's Business Database.
Questions they hope to answer with the data: Which states have the most and least fast food restaurants per capita?
