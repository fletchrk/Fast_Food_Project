# Fast_Food_Project
## Group Project Shared Repository

- Selected topic: Fast Food Restaurants across the United States

- Reason why topic was selected: The team selected this topic based on common interests among the team members. Several other topics were considered such as personality tests, Michelin restaurants and topics related to the pandemic. However, we settled on Fast Foods for logistical reasons, such as access to a complete data set. 

- Description of data source: The data set was obtained from kaggle.com and was uploaded by Datafiniti's Business Database. The data can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/fast-food-restaurants) The data is a sample of a much larger data and was selected randomly. By selecting the sample randomly, we expect the data to be representative of the complete data. 

- Questions we hope to answer with the data:
 
  1- Which states have the most and least fast food restaurants per capita?
  
  2- Which cities have the most and least McDonald's per capita?
  
  3- What are the Fast food restaurants per capita for all states?
  
  4- Which Fast food restaurants have the most locations nationally?
  
  5- What major cities have the most and least fast food restaurants per capita?
  
  6- What are the small cities with the most fast food restaurants per capita?
