Group Project Shared Repository

Selected topic: Fast Food Restaurants across the United States

Reason why topic was selected: The team selected this topic based on common interests among the team members. Several other topics were considered such as personality tests, Michelin restaurants and topics related to the pandemic. However, we settled on Fast Foods for logistical reasons, such as access to a complete data set. 

Description of data source: The data set was obtained from kaggle.com and was uploaded by Datafiniti's Business Database. The data can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/fast-food-restaurants)

Questions they hope to answer with the data: Which states have the most and least fast food restaurants per capita?
