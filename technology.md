# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Database Storage
Postgres SQL is the database we intend to use.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the Machine Learning library for Python we'll be using to create a supervised learning model. This entails creating the model, training the model and then creating predictions. More specifically we intend to use the linear regression model since our data is continuous and not categorical. 

## Dashboard
We will use Tableau for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard.
