Fast Food Project-Module20
README (THE BUSINESS CASE)

The Fast Food Project was initiated about 3 weeks ago, with the intent of discussing the pros and cons of the Fast Food Industry. The author is an advocate for more industry, more jobs, more prosperity and good health. In this context, the Business Case for fast food industry was made.
Currently, the Fast Food Industry has 196,000 restaurants in the USA, with a robust growth rate of 2200 per month. On annualized basis it is 8.9%. The industry is growing rapidly and major reason for its success is affordability and service time.  Thus it caters to those who want a fast meal, while going to work or on their break. This is the industry for the American Middle Class, whose incomes range from $12.50/hr. to $50/hr. The middle class is slated to grow, while the US population remains at 0.1% growth. As more people enter the middle class from poverty levels the customer base will increase. It may also increase, if the taxation rate on higher income wage earners puts them in the middle class. In any case, the middle class is going to grow.
The GDP of the USA is about 21 Trillion USD (2020) and went down 3.5% during the pandemic. It is expected to grow at 6 %.  The growth of the GDP is predicated on Consumer Spending and Consumer Confidence.
GDP = Consumer Spending + Government Spending +Investments +Savings
GNP = GDP +Exports/Imports (This can be a negative number if imports are greater than exports)

This is 2019 data, but in 2020 the Corona Virus took over, so all the GDP components and figures got smashed and the economy registered a 3.5% decline.  The economy is expected to grow at 6% this year. If this happens, it would be very good for the battered industries. The author’s projection is 3.75% growth, but less than 4%. In any case, the growth will bring us back to the pre-pandemic years, if no new outbreak occurs.
For the fast food industry, with the population remaining largely static, increase in the middle classes would help. Average family spends about $3000 per year on Fast Food. In other words, market has increased. With increased market, the industry would have good Return on Investment (ROI) and consequently attract investment capital. The current ROI is stated to be 20%, which is very high and quite good. The Chinese Fast Food Company-Pandas is advertising ROI of 25%.
So, it became important for to calculate and predict the future GDP. The regression prediction model proved to be unsatisfactory as it could not match the existing data. This was supervised learning.
Another model called the mathematical model proved better, it was piece-wise linear model, based on average growth rate of 5 years and updated every year with new data, it was a rolling forecast model.


 
This model provided a glimmer of hope, it was almost right, both the lines were matched.
  
  
  
 This model had lot of variance the shaded areas reflect upper and lower bounds, so it was discarded.
So the search for the model continued and the parameters were that it should have a notebook code and be accurate. In www.google.com such a model was found and incorporated.
 

This model the actual line matched the red line, which was drawn. We had the model, but we had no theory, so the author started to search literature, and is it turned out it was the TIME SERIES MODEL, which has been used for forecasting stock market.  The model is also taught in Industrial Engineering and in Statistics Classes (Statistics for Business and Economics: McClave, Benson, Sincich-9th Edition).
Both the TIME SERIES MODEL and the Mathematical Model can be used. Next year’s GDP would be a little above 2019 GDP. The GDP went down 3.5%, then comes up 3.75%, so it will be a recovery year.
So investment in Fast Food Industry is a strong buy.
